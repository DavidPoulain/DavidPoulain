### My goals ?

My goal is to become a solid frontend web developper. I want to be able to build dynamic and interactive web sites that will give great and memorable experiences to the user. But one step at a time. My first goal is to finish my training at O'clock, making my first project with a team of talented studens, and then working on several projects like my own portfolio for exemple.
